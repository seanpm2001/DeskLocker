# DeskLocker plans 2022 March 5th

## Important notes

All current planned platform versions will support the Python programming language, even if that means having to use Python 2 for backwards compatibility.

All versions will have the same core functionality as the original planned Ubuntu release, they will just be written for different platforms that support a desktop.

The notes in this document sorted in Alphabetical order (A-Z)

## New languages to use

* C

* C++

* C#

* F#

* Objective-C

* Pascal

* PowerShell

* Shell

* Swift

## New platforms to support

* Arch Linux (Starting with the first build from 2002 March 11th) - C, Python

* BSD (Various start points) - C, C++, Python

* Debian Linux (Starting with the base of Debian 2.x) - C, C++, Pascal, Python

* Fedora Linux (Starting with Fedora Core 1) - C, C++, Python

* Gentoo Linux (starting with the base of Gentoo 2.x) - C, C++, Python

* MacOS (Starting with version 10.0 Cheetah) - C, Objective-C, Python, Swift

* Windows (Starting with Windows 95) C#, F#, Pascal, PowerShell, Python

## Possible considerations

I am considering supporting Apple System 5 to Mac OS 9 if the desktop functionality can be manipulated in the intended way.

I am considering supporting Windows 3.1 with special programs that allow desktop support.
